# Open in StackEdit Chrome Extension
 Open a GitHub or Gitlab repository directory as a StackEdit workspace. Note: you must add your GitHub or GitLab account to the StackEdit.io app before using this or it will not work!

This extension is [available on the Chome Web Store here](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/open-in-stackedit/cfdcfpcdlahjkhliopcmbjillihpmabk).

Made with regular expressions and love :)
