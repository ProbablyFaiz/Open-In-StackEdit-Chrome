# Open in StackEdit Chrome Extension
 Open a GitHub or Gitlab repository directory as a StackEdit workspace. To use it, simply click the StackEdit icon in your Chrome extension toolbar when viewing a repository directory. The link on GitHub or GitLab should include "tree" in it. If not, explicitly select your branch or directory to ensure you're viewing a directory and not just the main repo page.
 
 Note: you must add your GitHub or GitLab account to the StackEdit.io app before using this or it will not work!

This extension is [available on the Chome Web Store here](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/open-in-stackedit/cfdcfpcdlahjkhliopcmbjillihpmabk).

Made with regular expressions and love :)
